# Deprecated

GraphQL supports marking fields, input fields, arguments and enum values as [`@deprecated`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec--deprecated) with an optional reason. These directives are used by tools like [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and [editor integrations](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay) to provide context to developers.

Grats supports this feature by using the `@deprecated` JSDoc tag. This tag can be used on fields, enum variants, and arguments. If the tag is followed by text, that text is used as the reason for the deprecation.

## Field example

<GratsCode out={DeprecatedExample} mode="ts" />

Would extract:

<GratsCode out={DeprecatedExample} mode="gql" />
