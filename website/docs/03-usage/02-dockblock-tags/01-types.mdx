# Types

GraphQL types can be defined by placing a `@gqlType` docblock directly before a:

- Class declaration
- Interface declaration
- Type alias of a literal type

If model your GraphQL resolvers using classes, simply add a `@gqlType` docblock
before the class conaining that type's resolvers.

<GratsCode out={TypesClass} mode="ts" />

If youre types are represented in your code by interfaces, simply add a
`@gqlType` docblock before the interface representing that type. Note that by
using `@gqlType` on an interface, Grats will treat it as a GraphQL type and not
an interface.

<GratsCode out={TypesInterface} mode="ts" />

Finally, if your types are represented in your code by named types, simply add a
`@gqlType` docblock before the type alias which describes that type.

<GratsCode out={TypesAlias} mode="ts" />

## Renaming Types

If you want to use a different name for your type in GraphQL than in your code, you can specify the name of the type in the `@gqlType` docblock tag. See [Renaming](../04-renaming.md) for more information.

<GratsCode out={TypesRenaming} mode="ts" />

Which would extract:

<GratsCode out={TypesRenaming} mode="gql" />

## Implementing Interfaces

If you are using classes to model your GraphQL resolvers, you can define your types as implementing a GraphQL interface by declaring that your class implements an interface which has been annotated with [`@gqlInterface`](./04-interfaces.md).

:::caution

Grats does not **yet** support implementing interfaces when you define your types using interfaces of type aliases, but support is on our roadmap.

:::

<GratsCode out={TypesImplementInterface} mode="ts" />

Will generate the following GraphQL schema:

<GratsCode out={TypesImplementInterface} mode="gql" />

:::note
If your type implements a GraphQL interface or is a member of a GraphQL
union, Grats will remind you to add a `__typename: "MyType"` property to your
class, type or interface.
