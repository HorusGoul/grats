**What if building a GraphQL server were as simple as just writing functions?**

When you write your GraphQL server in TypeScript, your fields and resovlers
are _already_ annotated with type information. _Grats leverages your existing
type annotations to automatically extract an executable GraphQL schema from your
generic TypeScript resolver code._

By making your TypeScript implementation the source of truth, you never have to
worry about valiating that your implementiaton matches your schema. Your
implementation _is_ your schema!

## How it works

Grats works as a **built step** which statically analyzes your TypeScript code and
extracts a `.graphql` schema file. This file can be shared with other tools, but
also used directly by Grats' slim runtime wrapper around `graphql-js` to build a
GraphQL endpoint.

To tell Grats which parts of your code to expose in the schema, simply annotate
them with [docblock tags](../04-dockblock-tags/index.md) like `/** @gqlField
*/`. Grats will scan your code for these tags and use them to automatically
build your schema.

:::note
In some cases Grats may prompt you to use more explicit type annotations to
ensure that it can "see" all the relevent type information.

## Example

Grats is flexible enough to work with both class-based and functional
approaches to authoring GraphQL types and resolvers. You can find a mix of both i

<GratsCode mode="ts" out={Example} />

## Output

The above example define the following GraphQL schema:

<GratsCode mode="gql" out={Examples} />
