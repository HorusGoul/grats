**What if building a GraphQL server were as simple as just writing functions?**

When you write your GraphQL server in TypeScript, your fields and resovlers
are _already_ annotated with type information. _Grats leverages your existing
type annotations to automatically extract an executable GraphQL schema from your
generic TypeScript resolver code._

By making your TypeScript implementation the source of truth, you never have to
worry about valiating that your implementiaton matches your schema. Your
implementation _is_ your schema!

## How it works

Grats works as a **built step** which statically analyzes your TypeScript code and
extracts a `.graphql` schema file. This file can be shared with other tools, but
also used directly by Grats' slim runtime wrapper around `graphql-js` to build a
GraphQL endpoint.

To tell Grats which parts of your code to expose in the schema, simply annotate
them with [docblock tags](../04-dockblock-tags/index.md) like `/** @gqlField
*/`. Grats will scan your code for these tags and use them to automatically
build your schema.

:::note
In some cases Grats may prompt you to use more explicit type annotations to
ensure that it can "see" all the relevent type information.

## Examples

Grats is flexible enough to work with both class-based and functional
approaches to authoring GraphQL types and resolvers.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="oop" label="Classes" default>

```ts
/** @gqlType */
type Query = unknown;

  /** @gqlField */
export function  me(_: Query): User {
  return new User();
}

/**
 * @gqlField
 * @deprecated Please use `me` instead. */
export function viewer(_: Query): User {
  return new User();
}

/**
 * A user in our kick-ass system!
 * @gqlType */
class User {
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string = "Alice";

  /** @gqlField */
  greeting(args: { salutation: string }): string {
    return `${args.salutation}, ${this.name}`;
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fp" label="Functional">

```ts
/** @gqlType */
export type Query = {};

/** @gqlField */
export function me(_: Query): User {
  return { name: "Alice" };
}

/**
 * @gqlField
 * @deprecated Please use `me` instead.  */
export function viewer(_: Query): User {
  return { name: "Alice" };
}

/**
 * A user in our kick-ass system!
 * @gqlType */
type User = {
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string;
};

/** @gqlField */
export function greeting(user: User, args: { salutation: string }): string {
  return `${args.salutation}, ${user.name}`;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Output

Both of the above examples define the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
  viewer: User @deprecated(reason: "Please use `me` instead.")
}

"""
A user in our kick-ass system!
"""
type User {
  name: String
  greeting(salutation: String!): String
}
```
