# Examples

Working minimal code examples are often the best way to see how a library should be configured. It gives a working starting point that one can borrow from when setting up their own project. To that end, Grats's repository contains a number of examples that demonstrate how to use Grats with various frameworks and libraries. Each example is covered by our integration tests to ensure it's in working order.

**Disclaimer:** Grats is still young and so we don't yet have many examples. If you have a working example of Grats in use with a framework or library that isn't covered here, please reach out on [Discord](https://capt.dev/grats-chat) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/captbaritone).
