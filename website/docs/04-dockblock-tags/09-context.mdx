# Context

The TypeScript type of your expected GraphQL execution context can be defined by placing a `@gqlContext` docblock directly before a:

- Declaration

During execution, each resolver will be passed a [context object](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers). Context is typically used to pass around information about the current request as well as inject database connections and other per-request caches, such as [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader)s into your resolvers.

Ensuring your resolvers functions/methods are expecting the context object to have the correct type can be difficult. Grats solves this by expecting you to annotate your context type's declaration with a `@gqlContext` docblock:

:::caution
It is an error to have more than one `@gqlContext` docblock in your project. Grats will error if it detects more than one.
:::

```ts
/** @gqlContext */
type GQLCtx = {
  req: express.Request;
  userID: string;
  db: Database;
};

/** @gqlField */
export function me(_: Query, args: never, ctx: GQLCtx): User {
  return ctx.db.users.getById(ctx.userID);
}
```

The context argument is passed as the third argument of resovler _functions_ and the second argument of resolver _methods_. If your resolver does not need access to the context object, you can omit the context argument.

:::tip
If you need to access the context object in your resolver, but your field does not define any args, you can type your args parameter as `never`.
:::

## Constructing your context object

The mechanism by which you construct your context object will vary depending upon the GraphQL server library you are using. See your GraphQL server library's documentation for more information.

:::caution
Grats can ensure that every resolver is expecting the correct context type, but it cannot ensure that your context object is constructed correctly. **It is up to you to ensure that your context object is constructed correctly and passed to the GraphQL execution engine.**
