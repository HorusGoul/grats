# Inputs

GraphQL input types can be defined by placing a `@gqlInput` docblock directly before a:

- Type alias declaration
- Interface declaration

```ts
/**
 * Description of my input type
 * @gqlInput <optional name of the input, if different from type name>
 */
type MyInput = {
  name: string;
};
```

```ts
/** @gqlInput */
interface MyInput {
  name: string;
}
```

Unlike with type or interface fields, every property of an input type is automatically included as part of the GraphQL definition. You do not need to annotate individual properties with `@gqlField`.

## Deprecated fields

Individual optional fields can be marked as `@deprecated` in the GraphQL schema using the `@deprecated` JSDoc tag:

```ts
/** @gqlInput */
type MyInput = {
  name: string;
  /** @deprecated Don't ask for age any more */
  age?: number;
};
```

## Merged Interfaces

TypeScript [merges interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#merging-interfaces) if you to define multiple interfaces with the same name in the same scope. For example, `Node` is a built-in interface that describes DOM nodes. So, if you define a `Node` interface in your code, TypeScript will merge your interface with the built-in one.

To avoid ambiguity, Grats will error if you try to define a GraphQL input type using a merged TypeScript interface. To avoid this error you can define a new interface, with a unique name, and then [rename](../03-resolvers/04-renaming.mdx) it to the name you want to use in your schema.
